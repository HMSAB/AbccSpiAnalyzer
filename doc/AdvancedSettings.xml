	<!-- "4-wire-on-3-channels" is useful when a 4-wire SPI configuration is used to	interface with
	the ABCC but only MOSI, MISO, and SCLK are connected to the Logic analyzer. This mode will
	ignore timing and CPOL/CPHA requirements that the ABCC's 3-wire mode enforces. -->

	<!-- "3-wire-on-4-channels" is useful when a 3-wire SPI configuration is used to interface with
	the ABCC but the user has a spare Logic channel that can be used as a dummy place holder for
	placing the markers that the plugin normally applied to the SPI Enable channel. -->

	<!-- "export-delimiter" allows the user to define a delimiter to use when using one of the
	plugin's supported export options. Any single (visible) character is accepted as a delimiter.
	A tab-delimiter can be specified by using "\t" without the quotes. -->
	<Setting name="export-delimiter">,</Setting>

	<!-- "clocking-alert-limit" provides the user with a way to restrict how many times a
	"clocking alert" event will be reported by the plugin. This can be useful in cases where a
	device's SPI chipselect line may "appear" to toggle at the same time the SPI clock transitions
	high after receiving the last bit in the SPI transaction. This event results in a
	"clocking alert" notification. This type of event is more of an informational warning/error
	event, and as long as the user understands the reason and deems the behavior acceptable, then
	this setting may be set to a value >=0. Setting the value to 0 disables the notification
	entirely. While any value	above zero (datatype is S32) will set a maximum count for producing
	the notification in the processed results. An invalid value or value <0 indicates that there is
	no limit. Users of the ABCC StarterKit may encounter this scenario since the chipselect line is
	deasserted close in time (~8ns) with the SPI clock returning to the "clock idle high" state.
	This results in a	higher than normal sampling time requirement to resolve the two events
	occurring at different points in time. Sampling more than 125MSamples/second is necessary to
	avoid this issue; thus, a general recommendation for this scenario is to use sampling rates of
	250MS/s or higher. If this is not possible due to hardware limitations of the PC/analyzer then
	it is recommended to set this parameter to a value >= 0 to limit how many times the error is
	reported. -->
	<Setting name="clocking-alert-limit">-1</Setting>

	<!-- "expand-bit-frames" provides a workaround for a limitation found in Saleae Logic software
	version 1.2.x. Specifically, the software does not properly navigate to the associated bubble
	text entry when clicking on a "Decoded Protocols" entry for a frame less than 8 samples.
	Currently, this workaround is only applicable for error frames; any error frame less than 8
	samples will be expanded to 8 samples to restore the linkage. This feature could have
	undesirable sideffects in rare circumstances. In case of abnormal behavior it may be necessary
	to disable this feature. -->
