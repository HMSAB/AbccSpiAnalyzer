	<!-- "4-wire-on-3-channels" is useful when a 4-wire SPI configuration is used to
	interface with the ABCC but only MOSI, MISO, and SCLK are connected to the Logic
	analyzer. This mode will ignore timing and CPOL/CPHA requirements that the ABCC's
	3-wire mode enforces. -->

	<!-- "3-wire-on-4-channels" is useful when a 3-wire SPI configuration is used to
	interface with the ABCC but the user has a spare Logic channel that can be used
	as a dummy place holder for placing the markers that the plugin normally applied
	to the SPI Enable channel. -->

	<!-- "export-delimiter" allows the user to define a delimiter to use when
	using one of the plugin's supported export options. Any single (visible)
	character is accepted as a delimiter. A tab-delimiter can be specified
	by using "\t" without the quotes. -->

	<!-- "clocking-alert-limit" provides the user with a way restrict how many
	times a "clocking alert" event will be reported by the plugin. This can be
	useful in cases where a device's SPI chipselect line may "appear" to toggle
	at the same time the SPI clock transitions high after receiving the last
	bit in the SPI transaction. This event results in a "clocking alert"
	notification. This type of event is more of an informational warning/error
	event, and as long as the user understands the reason and deems the behavior
	acceptable, then this setting may be set to a value >=0. Setting the value
	to 0 disables the notification entirely. While any value	above zero
	(datatype is S32)  will set a maximum count for producing the
	notification in the processed results. An invalid value or value <0 indicates
	that there is no limit.-->
	<Setting name="clocking-alert-limit">-1</Setting>
