The log files in this directory can be used for general reference or simulation
in the logic analyzer plugin using the "Advanced Settings" XML file. To activate
"log file simulation", the Advanced Settings "simulation" setting must specify
the path to the log file in the "LogFilePath" XML element. See the
"AdvancedSettings.xml" template in the parent directory for more details on
simulation.

The log files themselves are based on the ABCC SDK with minimal modifications.
Different ABCC SDK versions may produce different output.
